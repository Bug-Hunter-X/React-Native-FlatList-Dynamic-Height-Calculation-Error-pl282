To fix this, use the `estimatedItemSize` and `getItemLayout` props in your FlatList component.  `estimatedItemSize` provides an initial estimate of the item height, allowing FlatList to optimize its rendering. `getItemLayout` provides a more precise way to calculate the position of each item, ensuring accurate scrolling and layout.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index.toString()}
  estimatedItemSize={50} // Adjust as needed
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => (
    {
      length: 50, // Adjust as needed
      offset: 50 * index,
      index,
    }
  )}
/>
```
This approach greatly improves performance and eliminates layout issues caused by dynamic content heights.  Remember to adjust `estimatedItemSize` and the values in `getItemLayout` to match your average item height for optimal results.
