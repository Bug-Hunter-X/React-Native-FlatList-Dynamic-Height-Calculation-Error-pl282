This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native with dynamically sized list items. The bug showcases inaccurate rendering and layout problems due to FlatList's inability to correctly determine content heights.  The solution provides a fix using the `estimatedItemSize` and `getItemLayout` props to improve performance and rendering accuracy.
